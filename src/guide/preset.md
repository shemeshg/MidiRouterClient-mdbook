# Presets

Presets are containers for user-defined input configurations. They can be activated via mouse click or MIDI event, offering flexible and dynamic control.

Each preset holds its own distinct settings across all available input channels.

## Usage Notes

While multiple presets can be active at once, it's generally recommended to use only one at a time—especially when applying advanced input configurations such as 14-bit resolution or clock routing.

Using a single preset helps maintain clarity and avoids potential conflicts between overlapping input settings.
