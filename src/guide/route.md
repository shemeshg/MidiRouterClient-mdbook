# Route

A Route is a container for multiple chains, enabling modular and sequential processing of MIDI data.

## Chains

A `chain` defines a linear path composed of a series of `filters`. Each filter performs a specific transformation or analysis on the MIDI stream, allowing for flexible and customizable data manipulation as it traverses the chain.
