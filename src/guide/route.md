# Route

A **Route** is a container for multiple chains, enabling modular and sequential processing of MIDI data.

### Learning to Create Routes

If you're trying to understand how routes are built, the easiest way is to start with an `EasyConfig`. Once you've created one, inspect how it's automatically translated into a full route. This reverse-engineering method offers a hands-on, intuitive way to grasp the structure and logic of route creationâ€”without needing to dive into low-level details right away.

## Chains

A **chain** defines a linear path composed of a sequence of **filters**. Each filter performs a specific transformation or analysis on the MIDI stream, allowing for flexible and customizable data manipulation as it flows through the chain.

# Filter Types

### `TO_MIDI_DESTINATION`
Routes MIDI events to a specific local MIDI destination.

### `TO_CONSOLE`
Logs MIDI events to the console (either server or client). This filter is also used for inter-server communication, such as sending logged MIDI messages to a client or triggering preset changes via MIDI.

### `TO_NETWORK`
Sends all MIDI events to a remote destination.

### `SCHEDULE_TO`
Holds MIDI events and schedules them for future delivery based on `deferredType` and `deferredTo` parameters. Requires MIDI clock events to function properly.

### `FILTER_AND_TRANSFORM`
Allows both filtering and transforming MIDI event data. Transformation notation includes:

- `[[fromStart, fromEnd, toStart, toEnd]]` â€” Maps a range from `fromStart` to `fromEnd` onto `toStart` to `toEnd`.
- `[[fromStart, fromEnd, toStart]]` â€” Short form where `toEnd = toStart + (fromEnd - fromStart)`.
- `[[value1, value2]]` â€” Maps `value1` to `value2`.
- `[[value]]` â€” Equivalent to `[[value, value]]`, a single value mapping.
