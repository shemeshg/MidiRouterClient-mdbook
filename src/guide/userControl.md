# User Controls

Each preset can include interactive controls such as sliders, optionally paired with dropdown menus.

Only the controls associated with the currently selected preset are displayed.

These controls send MIDI events to a predefined local port. The following MIDI event types are supported:

- **Control Change (CC)**
- **Program Change**
- **NRPN (Non-Registered Parameter Number)**

The `is64Mode` flag interprets the value `64` as the center or zero point, commonly used for bipolar ranges.

Dropdowns can also be used to store and select predefined preset names.
