# Input Ports

This tab lets you set up and manage your input ports.  
Only ports that are currently connected will be shown.

## Port Settings

Here’s what you can adjust:

- **Ignore Message Types**: Choose which types of MIDI messages to ignore.
- **MIDI Clock Settings**: Control how MIDI clock signals are handled, including advanced options like converting `SPP` (Song Position Pointer) to time signatures.
- **14-bit CC Translation**: Enables more accurate conversion of 14-bit MIDI messages—for example, turning them into pitch wheel data.

## Routing Options

You can set up routing in two ways:

- **EasyConfig**: A simple, beginner-friendly tool that helps you create routing setups without needing to dive into technical details.
- **Routes**: A more advanced option for users who want full control over routing configurations.

EasyConfig automatically builds the Routes setup for you, so you get the best of both worlds!
