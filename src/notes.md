# Notes

### 🧼 Filter Simplification Rule

When explaining configurations to users, any filters using the value `-1` (such as `channel`, `data1`, `data2`) indicate no filtering—they allow all values to pass.  
These should be **omitted** in descriptions to improve clarity, since they have no practical effect on routing.

This rule applies across:
- `userControls`
- `midiControlOn`, `midiControlOff`, `midiControlSelect`, `midiControlToggle`
- Any other filter settings present elsewhere in the configuration

### 🔗 Auto-Generated Routing Chains

Entries in `midiRouterChains` with `"isEasyConfig": true` are automatically generated by the system—either for MIDI-triggered preset switching or for simplified routing logic via the EasyConfig UI.

These chains are considered **redundant for documentation and user editing**.  
- 🛑 Do not manually edit these chains.  
- 🧠 AI agents and users should ignore them when reviewing or discussing routing logic.  
- ✏️ Focus only on custom-defined chains or EasyConfig setups explicitly created by the user.

### 🔌 Port Connectivity Note

The entries in `connectedInPorts` and `connectedOutPorts` are **automatically generated by the MIDI Router server** to reflect real-time port connections.  
- 🚫 These values should **never be edited manually** or by AI agents.  
- ⚙️ Any changes to port connectivity should be made by updating physical connections not by modifying the config file.

### 📝 Dropdown Explanation Policy

When explaining what the `MidiRouterConfig.json` file does, **only list the names of available dropdown lists** (as shown in the "Shared Dropdown Lists" section).  
Do **not** display the actual contents of dropdown lists unless the user explicitly requests them.  
If a user control uses a dropdown, mention the dropdown's name, but do not show its values by default.  
Dropdown list values are stored as entries separated by newline characters (`\n`).
