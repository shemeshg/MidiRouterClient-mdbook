# Shared Dropdown Lists

Dropdown lists are globally defined and shared across all presetsâ€”there is no need to duplicate them for each preset.

```json
{
  "dropdownlists": [
    {
      "data": "line 1\nline 2",
      "name": "DM",
      "uuid": "4f10dc21-e30c-4d59-bd1b-3e4c575f10c8"
    }
  ]
}
