Create routes from anywhere to anywhere

Midi Router Client is an advanced, cross-platform tool designed to route and manipulate MIDI signals in real time. It allows users to create virtual MIDI ports, map MIDI events (e.g., CC to pitch wheel), monitor inputs, and build custom controls like program change dropdownsâ€”all with minimal latency
